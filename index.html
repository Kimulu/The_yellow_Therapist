              <p>As you could guess, we get that a lot. But we chose yellow because yellow is famously the happiest color, yellow is the symbol of happiness. So the therapists work here are yellow therapists in the best possible way, far from yellow journalists. So, no worries. Let's spread happiness.  </p>

              <p>After you sign up, we will match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful match most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your therapist isn't a good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different therapist.</p>

              <p>Therapists on TYT are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFT), licensed clinical social workers (LCSW / LMSW), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). All of them have a Masters Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state's professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. While their experience, expertise, and background vary, they all possess at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience.</p>
